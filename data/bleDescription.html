Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a wireless communication technology that enables data transmission over short distances with minimal energy consumption. BLE is ideal for applications requiring long battery life, such as wearable devices, sensors, smart homes, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. BLE operates at a frequency of 2.4 GHz and offers fast connections and low latency. Due to its low energy consumption, BLE allows continuous monitoring and data transmission without frequent device charging. This technology is widely used in health, fitness, location tracking, and many other applications.
