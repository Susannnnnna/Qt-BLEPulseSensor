    Pulse Sensor is a device that measures the pulse, which is the rhythmic beating of the heart. It is often used in health and fitness applications to monitor the user's heart rate. The Pulse Sensor operates on the principle of photoplethysmography (PPG), where an LED light is emitted onto the skin, and an optical sensor measures changes in the intensity of the reflected light caused by blood flow. This allows for accurate heart rate measurements. The Pulse Sensor is easy to use and can be integrated with various devices such as smartphones, smartwatches, and other wearable devices.
