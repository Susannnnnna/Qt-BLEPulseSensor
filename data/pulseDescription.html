    Pulse, also known as heart rate, is the rhythmic beating of the heart as it pumps blood through the body's arteries. It is typically measured in beats per minute (BPM). The pulse can be felt at various points on the body where arteries are close to the skin, such as the wrist, neck, and temple. Monitoring pulse is important for assessing cardiovascular health and fitness levels. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 BPM. Factors such as physical activity, stress, and overall health can influence pulse rate. Regular monitoring of pulse can help detect potential health issues early and guide lifestyle adjustments for better heart health.
